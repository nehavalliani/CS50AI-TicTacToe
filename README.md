# TicTacttoe
Added AI functionality with python to the game so that either the computer wins or it is a tie. 

# The Game
A 1-player tic tac toe game, with the computer as the opponent. It starts by asking the player to choose the sign (0 or X). Once decided, the game starts and the player and the opponent both get a chance to fill the boxes with their respective signs alternatively until any one of them gets their marked on 3 consecutive boxes on the board.

# Artificial Intelligence implemented
With the AI functionality added to the game, it is almost impossible for the player to win; the computer tracks all the next moves of the player before deciding to place its sign on any of the bozes.
So the game is always either won by the computer, or ends up in a tie.
